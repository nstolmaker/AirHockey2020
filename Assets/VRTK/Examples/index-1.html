<p><em>VRTK offers a VR Simulator that works without any third party SDK, but VR device support requires a supported VR SDK to be imported into the Unity project.</em></p>

<p>The example scenes support all the VRTK supported VR SDKs. To make use of VR devices (besides the included VR Simulator) import the needed third party VR SDK into the project.</p>
<p>For further information about setting up a specific SDK and using VRTK in your own project, check out the
